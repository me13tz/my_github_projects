Looking for a new gig in software development after several years in IT support, and 
then as a Telecomm Technician. I have an extensive technical background, with a special talent for 
pattern recognition and an ability to digest new technologies rapidly. 

Top notch English skills, both written and verbal. I also have a talent for explaining technology to people who don't understand technology. 

I'm hoping to land a job within the next year as an entry-level Python developer. My self-study has leaned toward data using the Anaconda distribution, but I'm also learning Xcode/Swift.

This is a repository where I am storing my Python files for others, including potential employers, to view and use as
they wish. 

I am seeking to transition into software development after several years in Tier II Information Technology support, and 
then as a Telecomm Technician. I have an extensive technical background, with a special talent for 
pattern recognition and an ability to digest new technologies rapidly. Top notch English skills, both written and verbal.

I'm hoping to land a job in or near Boston, MA within the next year as an entry-level developer. My self-study has leaned toward data, using pandas via the Anaconda distribution, but I'm up for just about anything.  

If you would like to get in touch with me, email me at me33tz@gmail.com.

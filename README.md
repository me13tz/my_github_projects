This is a repository where I am storing my Python files for others, including potential employers, to view and use as
they wish. 

I am seeking to transition into software development after several years in Tier II Information Technology support, and 
several years as a Central Office Technician. I have an extensive technical background, with a special talent for 
pattern recognition and an ability to digest new technologies rapidly. Top notch English skills, both written and verbal.

Hoping to land a job in or near Boston, MA within the next year as an entry-level developer, or in a position where
the transition to it would be attainable. 

If you would like to get in touch with me, email me at: me13tz@yahoo.com. 

Josh

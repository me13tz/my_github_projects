Looking for a new gig in software development after several years in IT support, and 
then as a Telecomm Technician. I have an extensive technical background, with a special talent for 
pattern recognition and an ability to digest new technologies rapidly. 

Top notch English skills, both written and verbal. I also have a talent for explaining technology to people who don't understand technology. 

I'm hoping to land a job within the next year as an entry-level Python developer. My self-study has led me to develop code on all platforms, with Linux being my favorite. Seeking an employment situation where I can learn the ropes and be the best developer I can be.
